# Java Demo Project by Tomasz Gomoradzki

(application is in beta testing/development phase)

Java Demo Project is stand alone, self explanatory desktop application that should be considered as developer portfolio.
It consist of several sub-programs, all gathered and shared on GitHub within one project to present extensive sample of my programming skills.

To launch the Demo project go to src/main/java/com/start and run Main class.
