# Java Demo Project by Tomasz Gomoradzki

Java Demo Project is stand alone, self explanatory desktop application that should be considered as developer's portfolio.
It consist of several projects, all gathered and shared on GitHub within one application to present extensive sample of my programming skills.

Feel invied to watch project video presentation available at YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/gosston/videos

To launch the Demo project go to src/main/java/com/start and run Main class.

Application has been developed with Eclipse Java EE IDE Oxygen v. 4.7, uses Java 8, JavaFX, including FXML, CSS, Controlers classes. For the most part it has been developed based on Model View Controller architectural pattern. From a MVC perspective, the FXML file describes user interface is the view. Dedicated Java class is declared as the controller for the view. The model consists of controler classes, user interface and code, that handles the application background logic and connects to the view through the controller.


Moreover some of the technologies and concepts used are:

- Java Composition and Encapsulation concepts

- Design Patterns: Factory, Observer, Strategy

- HashMap, TreeMap, Comparator, ObjectOutputStream, Object Serialization

- FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader,  BufferedWriter, Catching IOExceptions

- SQL, Oracle Express 11g, driver library ojdbc6.jar, JTables, Swing, swing.JTextField, swing.table.DefaultTableModel

- Collections, including Observable list, LinkedList, ArrayList, objects Inheritance, java.time library, Comparable Interface implementation, Comparator, sorting

- Threads. using Java Concurrency, implementation of 'Runnable' interface, inheritance of 'Task' observable class

- JFrame, libraries: java.awt.Graphics2D, awt.Polygon, util.concurren, including concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.

More details on the technologies and concept used are available within the application itself (appropriate modules of user interface).
