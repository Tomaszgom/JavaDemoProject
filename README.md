# Java Demo Project by Tomasz Gomoradzki

(application is still in alpha development phase)

Java Demo Project is stand alone, self explanatory desktop application that can be considered developer portfolio.
It consist of several sub-programs, all gathered and shared on GitHub within one project to present extensive sample of my programming skills.

To launch the Demo project go to src/main/java/com/start and run Main class.
